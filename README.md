Thanks for downloading NeXi-Client. Just incase i'm gonne explain what exactly 'NeXi-Client' is

NeXi-Client is a unofficial client for the browser game called 'Venge.io' made by NeXi. This client is not official created by the devs of 'Venge.io' and is not affiliated with them any kind. This client is NOT a virus and won't harm your PC or either your account in 'Venge.io'. Anyone telling that it is a virus or a creditals stealer is completely wrong. If you don't believe me then please refer deleting the client again. This client is made to have easier navigation by utilizing shortcuts while giving the least input delay & the maximum of FPS together.

Client Shortcuts:

F1 - Leaves the game back to the main menu

F2 - Opens the Link Menu where you can join your friends via a Invite link

F4 - Quits the Client

F10 - Switches the game to Windowed Mode

F11 - Switches the game to Fullscreen Mode

How to install it: Just drag the 'NeXiClient' folder somewhere you can find it again (e.x Desktop) and start the NeXiClient file inside the folder

If you encounter any bugs & problems then please. Join my discord and let me now about it.
