# NeXi-Client

## Introduction

NeXi-Client is a unofficial client for the browser game called 'Venge.io'. This client is not officially created by the devs of 'Venge.io' and NeXi is not affiliated with the 'Venge.io' team in any way. This client is NOT a virus and won't harm your PC or your 'Venge.io' account. Anyone saying that it is a virus or a credentials stealer is completely wrong. If you don't believe me then you may delete the client. This client is made to be easier to navigate by utilizing shortcuts. It also maximises FPS and reduces input lag.
